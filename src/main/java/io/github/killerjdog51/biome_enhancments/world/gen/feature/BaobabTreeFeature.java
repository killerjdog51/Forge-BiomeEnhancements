*
* Description of tree generation mechanics and how I personally handle tree generation
*
* I have decided to implement comments within my tree generation code for my Minecraft mod in case I ever wanted to reference it for another project,
* required to return to it in the future due to an issue, or if other people wished to understand how tree generation works in the game of Minecraft.
* Because when you first open up a tree generation file it can look confusing and complicated.
* This is mostly because Mojang uses a waterfall technique for generating trees, which is generally frowned upon in the programming/computer science community.
* It is much more respected to utilize functions/methods to make your code more readable and understandable for other people.
* Another benefit to using functions is that they are re-callable.
* So when creating more complex trees like I have, it is usually a good idea to use functions and split complex code into more manageable pieces.
* 
* I will try my best to walk through my code and explain what is happening.
* But first I wanted to point out that Minecraft tree generation is split into two parts, checking/testing and then generating.
* Minecraft uses mutable blocks to pre-generate the tree to make sure it can fully be completed or will fit within a designated bounding box.
* Essentially, this is the code that is used to prevent a tree from being generated from too small of a space.
* This code is usually the same for all trees, so there isn’t too much that needs to be altered here or should be fretted about (I will explain it as best I can none the less though). 
* 
* The important part is the generation portion. Once the game confirms that the tree is capable of generating within a certain spot then it will create the tree within the game.
* You can tackle this however you wish, but I generally prefer to start big (or from a central point) and then go small (or move away from that central point.
* Another thing that I prefer to do is split my tree generation into different parts/features or more manageable layers.
* I will first build a mock-up of my tree in the game and separate the major differences/unique parts of the tree.
* I will then write down on paper the technicalities of how I want the tree to generate.
* This includes a min and max height for my tree, if I want any special properties in how the tree generates (does the tree generate branches or roots? And how do they generate?),
* and anything else I think is necessary to understand before writing the code for generating my tree. 
* 
* Now that I have briefly explained why I generate my trees using functions,
* how Minecraft tree generation generally works and how it can be split into two defining portions,
* and how I handle defining/generating my trees it is time to look at the actual code.

*
* Description of Baobab tree generation/mechanics
*
* Baobabs are giant trees, while shorter than the other mega trees, they are much wider.
* Baobabs generate in a 4x4 (16 blocks per layer) and are capable of generating anywhere between 8 to 18 blocks in height.
* Their primary feature is their top branches. Baobabs will always generate one set (of four branches in each cardinal direction),and are capable of generating a second set.
* It is also possible that a branch may be omitted from generating or that a branch will generate in the same location as another
* (mutable blocks only check if a block currently exists in a location, it does not account for future blocks).
* Baobab’s secondary feature is their side branches. These side branches will generate anywhere from zero to two sets and may also be omitted or generated over.
* The last two features of the Baobab worth mentioning are that it does generate leaves as well as roots.

   /**
   *
   * Lots of weird Branch functions
   *
   * I needed to create each set of branches the same way (using the four cardinal directions).
   * But I have two different kind of branches that generate in their own unique way (top and side branches)
   * and also using a different amount of branches (top layer will always have one set while side layer will have zero to two sets)
   * 
   * So I set the amount of branches in the first function and the type of branches being generated (the true/false since there are only two different kinds of branches).
   * 
   * I then go into the same "createBranches" function which will generate the sets of branches. 
   * This function also randomly chooses where the branches protrude from and the respected log orientation. 
   * Basically, I go to each cardinal direction and set the log direction to match with it.
   * Then I choose one of the four blocks on that side of the tree to generate the branch from.
   * Finally, depending on the type of branch that we set in the first function (true/false), we go into the function for that specific branch generation.
   * 
   * The final (specified) branch function takes care of generating the branch in a random way.
   * This ensures that each individual branch is unique.
