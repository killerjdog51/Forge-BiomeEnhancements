*
* Description of tree generation mechanics and how I personally handle tree generation
*
* I have decided to implement comments within my tree generation code for my Minecraft mod in case I ever wanted to reference it for another project,
* required to return to it in the future due to an issue, or if other people wished to understand how tree generation works in the game of Minecraft.
* Because when you first open up a tree generation file it can look confusing and complicated.
* This is mostly because Mojang uses a waterfall technique for generating trees, which is generally frowned upon in the programming/computer science community.
* It is much more respected to utilize functions/methods to make your code more readable and understandable for other people.
* Another benefit to using functions is that they are re-callable.
* So when creating more complex trees like I have, it is usually a good idea to use functions and split complex code into more manageable pieces.
* 
* I will try my best to walk through my code and explain what is happening.
* But first I wanted to point out that Minecraft tree generation is split into two parts, checking/testing and then generating.
* Minecraft uses mutable blocks to pre-generate the tree to make sure it can fully be completed or will fit within a designated bounding box.
* Essentially, this is the code that is used to prevent a tree from being generated from too small of a space.
* This code is usually the same for all trees, so there isn’t too much that needs to be altered here or should be fretted about (I will explain it as best I can none the less though). 
* 
* The important part is the generation portion. Once the game confirms that the tree is capable of generating within a certain spot then it will create the tree within the game.
* You can tackle this however you wish, but I generally prefer to start big (or from a central point) and then go small (or move away from that central point.
* Another thing that I prefer to do is split my tree generation into different parts/features or more manageable layers.
* I will first build a mock-up of my tree in the game and separate the major differences/unique parts of the tree.
* I will then write down on paper the technicalities of how I want the tree to generate.
* This includes a min and max height for my tree, if I want any special properties in how the tree generates (does the tree generate branches or roots? And how do they generate?),
* and anything else I think is necessary to understand before writing the code for generating my tree. 
* 
* Now that I have briefly explained why I generate my trees using functions,
* how Minecraft tree generation generally works and how it can be split into two defining portions,
* and how I handle defining/generating my trees it is time to look at the actual code.

/**
*
* Description of Mangrove tree generation/mechanics
*
* Mangroves are a new Swamp specific tree. Like most other Minecraft trees they generate with a single trunk and have a boxy leaf top.
* Unlike other trees, Mangroves generate with vines (similar to mega jungle trees).
* The most unique feature though is that when generated under water,
* mangroves will naturally sprawl their knarly roots out from the base of the tree to create an cool-looking root mound.
* This is a possible way to get more wood from the sapling.
* Another thing to note is that the Mangrove saplings are water-logable, but won’t generate under 3 blocks of water
